# Potato-Disease-Classification-

Description : Here I used **Artificial Intelligence** in diagnosing plant diseases. Various diseases like early blight and late blight immensely influence the quality and quantity of the potatoes and manual interpretation of these leaf diseases is quite time-taking and cumbersome. Therefore I created a Web App using **Streamlit** which simply classify Potato Leaf Diseases and, finally deployed the **Web-app** on Heroku. Internally, our model is built using a simple **Convolutional Neural Network Architecture** to **classify Potato Leaf Diseases**. Initially I collected ready-made data from internet. Then due to small size of dataset, I used one of the simple and effective method, called **Data Augmentation** to increase the size of dataset as well as to reduce overfitting of our model. At the end built a Deep Learning Model to detect or classify Potato Leaf Diseases and got a test accuracy of **99.71%**.


Classification of Potato Disease Classification using **CNN**  based on
1) **Early Blight**
2) **Late Blight**
3) **Healthy Blight**
